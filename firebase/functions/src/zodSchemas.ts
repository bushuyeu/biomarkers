 * Local shim for Zod schemas used inside Cloud Functions.
 *
 * We deliberately `require()` the real schema file at runtime instead of letting
 * TypeScript pull it into the compilation tree. This avoids the
 *   error TS6059: File 'X' is not under 'rootDir' â€¦
 * because the real file lives outside firebase/functions/src.
 *
 * If you later move the canonical schemas into a shared workspace or copy them
 * into functions/, you can delete this shim and switch back to a normal
 * `export * from "..."`.
